# gogh — take it for a spin

gogh is a freeform canvas for WordPress. Drag anything anywhere on the live page — the words, the pictures, the button, even the sky — and it publishes clean, responsive core blocks. Deactivation-safe, theme-native, no lock-in.

Every link below builds a fresh, throwaway WordPress site in your browser with gogh already installed and you already logged in. Nothing to install. Give it a minute to boot, and use a desktop browser: Chrome, Edge or Firefox.

## Try it

- **Elliot Grey — a photographer's site.** Editorial, black and white, the default demo.
  https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamiemarsland/gogh-demo/main/blueprint.json&storage=temp
- **The Yellow House — a little gallery in Arles**, classic header, no shop.
  https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamiemarsland/gogh-demo/main/blueprint-classic.json&storage=temp
- **The Yellow House with a shop** — WooCommerce, four prints, gogh's shop looks.
  https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamiemarsland/gogh-demo/main/blueprint-experiments.json&storage=temp
- **Halcyon — a film studio.** Dark, cinematic, parallax hero and veiled portfolio cards.
  https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamiemarsland/gogh-demo/main/blueprint-film-studio.json&storage=temp
- **Hollowell — a ceramics studio's shop.** WooCommerce with twelve pots in four glazes: gogh's canvas around Woo's rails.

Things to try once you're in: drag the headline somewhere else, roll the die on a section (the ⚄ in the section pill) to see three more takes on the same words, open the header from the page, and publish. The site lives only in that tab — closing or refreshing it starts over. Swap `storage=temp` for `storage=browser` at the end of a link if you'd rather it survived a refresh.
